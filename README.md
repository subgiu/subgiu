### Hi friend! ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a Computer Science professional with more than 14 years of experience in software development.
I started as a full-stack engineer, becoming a technical leader and guided developers technically, I was also a team coordinator, and a software architect, empowering developers to do their best, and think about requirements like performance, scalability, reliability, among others.

Also as Chief Technology Officer (CTO) in a startup, I was responsible for all the technical aspects from the beginning,
coordinating the team using agile methodologies like Scrum, releasing features as fast as possible. 
In two months, we reduced the number of medical sick notes by 20%.

Now, I am hoping to use my experience to help to provide solutions that will impact peopleâ€™s lives, that will turn peopleâ€™s lives better. 
It is a big motivation for me.

 #### I am an architecture enthusiast and am fascinated to provide solutions that empower developers to do their best, providing agile solutions in the Full-Stack.
