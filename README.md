### Hi friend! ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a Computer Science professional with more than 14 years of experience in software development.  
Full-stack engineer, technical leader, team coordinator, and software architect.

I was also a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) in a startup, responsible for all the technical aspects from the beginning.  
In two months, we reduced the number of medical sick notes by 20%.

Now, I hope to use my experience to help provide solutions that will impact peopleâ€™s lives, making them better.  
It is a big motivation for me.
